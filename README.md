# Emotion Classification Through Deep Learning #

### Our team created an Emotion Classification System that: ###

  1) takes as input video feed with a person's face
  
  2) through deep learning, classifies the emotion the face is currently feeling
  
  3) outputs this emotion. 
  
## SEE Jupyter/Google Colab Notebooks and Documents for more details.
